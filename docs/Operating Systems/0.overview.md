# Overview

In this section, you will find various notes covering multiple topics in **Operating Systems**.

This section focuses on **Cybersecurity** at the system level, addressing how operating systems enforce protection and how they can be exploited. It is divided into two subsections:

---

**[Security Mechanisms](./Cybersecurity/Security%20Mechanisms/Protection%20in%20Operating%20Systems.md)**  
Covers the protection strategies built into operating systems, including access control models, privilege separation, and runtime security enforcement.

---

**[Vulnerabilities](./Cybersecurity/Vulnerabilities/Buffer%20Overflows.md)**  
Explores common low-level software vulnerabilities that arise in system programming, such as buffer overflows, format string exploits, and race conditions.
