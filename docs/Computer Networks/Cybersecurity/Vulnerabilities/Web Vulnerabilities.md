The Web has vastly expanded over the past couple of decades, and with this came the emergence of thousands of **vulnerabilities**, and subsequently, **attacks** across the Internet. But why is the Web source for so many vulnerabilities? The truth is that the Web gathers all of three factors that mainly influence vulnerabilities, which are:

- **Complexity**
- **Extensibility**
- **Connectivity**

Furthermore, the Web is not a "single" technology, but rather a conglomerate of several technologies and frameworks (HTTP, HTTPS, HTML, XML, JavaScript, SQL, servers, browsers, etc.). Such complexity and heterogeneity, allied with the easiness of use and accessibility of the Internet, will **inevitably** lead to **security breaches** and **attacks**.

Because of this complexity, there are **many vulnerabilities** that affect the Web; below are links to notes of some of the more common vulnerabilities, such as:

- **[[XSS Vulnerabilities|XSS Vulnerabilities (Cross Site Scripting)]]**
- **[[Database Vulnerabilities|Database Vulnerabilities (SQL Injections)]]**
- **[[XML Injection]]**
