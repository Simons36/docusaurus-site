# Firewalls and IDS

---
In this note, we take a look at how do firewalls work, why we need them and potential benefits and issues with their usage. We also take a look at what is an IDS, and its differences to a firewall.

---

A firewall is a security mechanism that prevents unauthorized access and attacks to a **local machine** or **local network**. A firewall is usually placed between an **untrusted network** (for example, the Internet) and a **trusted network** that we **want to protect** (for example, and organization's LAN), acting as a barrier to only allow **authorized traffic** to pass through it.

Therefore, a firewall:
- Creates a **perimeter defense**
- Prevents illegal **accesses/modifications** from **outside sources** to internal state
- Mitigates **DDOS** attacks
- Is a way of enforcing **access control policies** in a **centralized** manner

One of the ways a firewall does all this is through **packet filtering**.

## Packet Filtering

Packet filtering consists in analyzing all the traffic that passes through the machine that the firewall is running at, and allow some packets to **go through**, and others to **be discarded**. This filtering is decided according to the a set of **rules**, established in the firewall.

A general **firewall rule** will have the following format:

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240110124739.png)<br></br>**Fig.1:** Structure of a firewall rule

**Parameters:**

- **Rule Number:** rule identifier
- **Source Interface:** identifies the interface from where the packet has come from (example: internet, LAN)
- **Source IP:** IP address of the sender of the packet
- **Source Port:** From which port in the sender was the packet sent
- **Transport Protocol:** What protocol was used to transmit this packet (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
- **Destination IP:** The target IP of this packet
- **Destination Port:** The target port of this packet
- **State:** This parameter evaluates if the sender of this packet already has a connection established, or if it is a new connection (can have different rules for the two cases)
- **Action:** The previous parameters classify a certain packet. The action parameter will indicate whether packets that fall into this classification should be **accepted** or **dropped**

A firewall will have a set of these rules, that will determine its behavior during packet analysis. Let's consider the following example: 
Imagine we are an organization, with a LAN for employees connected to the internet. In that LAN, we also have our **web server** running, that should be accessed by our clients through the Internet. If we have a firewall between the Internet and the LAN, the rule set might be something like this:

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240110143436.png)<br></br>
**Fig.2:** Example of a firewall rule set

- We allow every established connection to go through with **Rule 1**
- We allow external users to access the web server **via HTTPS** (TCP, port 80) with **Rule 2**
- We allow our employees to access external HTTPS servers with **Rule 3**
- We allow **DNS requests** from our employees with **Rule 4**
- Every other type of connection attempt is **dropped** with **Rule 5**

:::info
 Bear in mind that the firewall analyzes the rules from the **top to the bottom**; therefore, we can have the rule to drop all packets in the last position and it doesn't affect the other rules
:::

Generally, firewalls are more strict about **incoming TCP and UDP traffic** than **outgoing traffic** for these protocols, allowing for employees to still access external applications. Firewalls should also any **malformed** TCP and UDP requests (to prevent, for example, scan attacks).

## Placement

We will now discuss where should we should place the **firewall**, and how can we design the local network to make it more secure. The firewall is usually running in a machine dedicated to itself, and it will be placed between a **more trusted** subnet and a **less trusted** subnet.

### DMZ (DeMilitiarized Zone)

A **DMZ** is a part of the network (subnet) that doesn't belong to the LAN, and is generally less secure than the LAN; however, we still keep some control over it (unlike the internet). We generally want to put **web servers** inside DMZ's, because they are more likely to suffer attacks, but we don't want to compromise the LAN, and we can still implement security in the DMZ.

### Core Topologies

We will present two ways arranging an organization's network that provides web services:

#### Core Topology 1: **Dual-homed host**

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240110155657.png)<br></br>
**Fig.3:** Example of a dual-homed host topology

There is a single firewall (bastion host), separating the two existing subnets: **OUT** and **IN** (where the local machines and web servers are placed)

- **Advantages:**
	- Simple and easy to manage
	- Resource economy

- **Disadvantages:** 
	- A single machine has to analyze **all the traffic** (traffic analysis is expensive!)
	- If we want to expose the web servers, the firewall is of no use
	- No separation between protected network and public servers

#### Core Topology 2: Screened Subnets

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240110160412.png)<br></br>
**Fig.4:** Example of a screened subnets topology

In this case the **routers will do the packet filtering**, and we will have two of them: one between the **OUT** subnet and the **DMZ**, and another between the **DMZ** and the **IN** network.
Public servers are placed in the **DMZ**, and local machines in the protected network.

- **Advantages:**
	- Public servers are now separated from the protected network
	- Lower risk regarding a firewall being compromised
- **Disadvantages:**
	- Lower control over the activities in the **DMZ**

:::note
If network isolation is possible through network virtualization, it might be a good option to consider several DMZ's, one for each type of server, to from several "layers" of security

## Firewall Implementation on Linux (iptables)

To implement a packet-filtering firewall on Linux hosts, a program that is commonly used is [**iptables**](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables). Iptables is a program that uses the framework [**netfilter:**](https://www.netfilter.org/) a Linux framework for packet filtering.

To understand iptables, there are three important concepts that we need to know: **tables**, **chains** and **rules**. The way these are correlated is the following:

1. **Tables** contain **chains**
2. **Chains** contain **rules**

There are three different tables in iptables: **NAT** (for natting), **Mangle** (used to arbitrarily modify packets) and **Filter** (the one used for our purpose, firewall configuration).
### Filter Table

The filter table has **three chains:**

- **OUTPUT** chain, corresponds to packets that are originated by a **local process in the host**, and are directed to the outside
- **INPUT** chain, corresponds to packets that are originated from **outside** the host, and are **directed at the host**
- **FORWARD** chain, which corresponds to packets originating from **outside** the host, and are meant to be **forwarded** to another machine

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240111115742.png)<br></br>
**Fig.5:** Flowchart of how packets can be assigned to different chains

All packets being filtered by this firewall will fall into one of these there categories, and will then be treated (accept or drop) according to the rules that have been set.

Additional material on iptables can be found [here.](#iptables)

## Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls

Like we saw in the [packet filtering](#packet-filtering) chapter, a firewall can decide to drop or accept packets based on the **state** of the connection of the two machines that are communicating. A good example of this is **TCP sessions:** before starting a conversation, there needs to be a **three-way handshake** (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), making it easy to record which machines have an established connection. For UDP, there is no such mechanism, but we can still approximate a connection through patterns and the addresses and ports of the packets.

Now, for keeping track of existing connections, the firewall will need to keep some type of **state**. This means we will have firewalls that keep track of state (**stateful**); and others that don't (**stateless**).

- **Stateful firewalls:** Keep track of previously established connections
	- NEW and ESTABLISHED in the _"state"_ rule field
- **Stateless firewalls:** Analyze each packet **independently**
	- They can still decide whether it's a new connection or not based on **packet content and flags**

There advantages and disadvantages to the two types of firewalls. **Stateful firewalls** have the downside of being **more expensive** to run (due to memory consumption), but have the upside of requiring **fewer rules** to setup. On the other hand, **stateless firewalls** are less expensive to run, but require more rules.

The performance of a firewall is directly linked to the **number of rules** (less rules is better). Therefore, the choice between a stateful or a stateless firewall should be done according to your **security policy**.

- If our policy only requires a small set of rules, a **stateless firewall** might be more appropriate
- If more rules are needed, it might be better to use a **stateful firewall**, due to it requiring less rules

:::note
An additional advantage of using the least amount of rules to setup a firewall is to reduce the **likelihood** of **configuration errors** 
:::

## Firewall Types

All of the firewalls seen previously have been of one type: [Packet Filters](#packet-filtering). However, there are two additional types of firewall: **Circuit-Level Gateway** and **Application-Level Gateway**. We will now take a closer into them.

### Circuit-Level Gateway

A circuit-level gateway usually operates in the **transport layer** (ex., TCP). In this type of firewall, a client application no longer communicates directly with the server, but will instead communicate with the **gateway**, which will act as a **relay** between the client and the server. The standard protocol for circuit-level gateways is **SOCKS** (**SOCK**ets **S**ecure).

### SOCKS

SOCKS is a circuit-level gateway standard for, running on a UNIX server, comprised of three components:

- **SOCKS Server:** running in the firewall machine
- **SOCKS Client Library:** running on the hosts protected by the firewall
- **SOCKS-ified versions of client programs:** altered versions of protocols normally used, like FTP, TELNET,...

In SOCKS, a client will initiate a connection to the SOCKS Server (TCP, port 1080) and will negotiate the **authentication method** and **authenticate** itself. Then, every time the client needs to send a request to the server, it will send a **relay request** to the SOCKS Server; it is then that the SOCKS Server will act as a firewall, either deciding to **drop** or **accept** the request. If accepted, the request will be relayed to the server, and its response will then be sent to the client.

![](img/Pasted%20image%2020240111153638.png)<br></br>
**Fig.6:** Diagram of SOCKS's architecture

### Application-Level Gateway

Application-level gateways operate on the **application layer**, analyzing and modifying packets' content. Typically, this firewall is running in a **proxy** server, and typically there is a proxy for each protocol. Some characteristics of the proxy operation are:

- User-oriented access control
- Packet content analysis and modification
- Detailed **logging** of ongoing operations
- **Caching:** keeps copies of frequently requested data

### Comparison between firewall types

**Packet Filter:**
- Faster but harder to configure
- Cannot control 'misbehaving' protocols (for example, ftp)
- Stateless does not consider previously sent packets

**Application-level gateways:**
- Slower but easier to configure
- Can make rules independently for each protocol
- Allows for authentication mechanisms
- Less adaptable to new protocols

:::note
Circuit-level gateways are not present here because, other than the fact that they operate in the Transport layer, they are very similar to the application-level gateways, and end up having the same upsides/downsides.

## Issues with firewalls

There are some known issues with firewalls, like:

- **Exploring open ports:** There is almost always a port open, for example port 80 for HTTP requests. There are many attacks that use this port
- **IP Spoofing:** An attacker can cover its IP address with another one (spoofing), making it impossible for firewalls to know the true source IP
- If we are using an **application-level gateway**, each protocol has to have its gateway
- Depending on the rules setup, there is always the tradeoff between **security** and **communication with outside world**.
- There are attacks that can **bypass** a firewall (for example, dial-up link, wireless, cellular router, ...)
- Firewalls do not protect from attacks **inside** the protected network (for example, an employee might bring his personal USB drive, already infected with some type of virus)

# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

**IDSs** are systems designed to **monitor** a particular network or host, log activity and **report** about suspect behavior that might be an **attack** on the system it is protecting. There are both **passive** IDSs (only notify about potential attacks) and **active** IDSs (can take action to mitigate attack).

## Why use an IDS

In the [previous chapter](#firewalls-and-ids), we saw how **firewalls** can prevent attacks, so why should we need an IDS? The truth is that, for any given system, no matter how secure it is and how many security systems there are, there will **always be vulnerabilities** (can either be known or unknown). Therefore, an IDS is a good **complimentary** system to a firewall, in the sense that if a firewall fails to prevent an attack, an IDS can detect it and take appropriate measures.

When prevention fails, an IDS can be a valuable tool. Some of the advantages of using an IDS are:

- Detect ongoing external intrusions
- Detect preliminary phases of attacks
- Detect intrusion from an **internal source** (malicious staff, phishing, etc.)
	- It is a bigger concern due to **less strict** security policies for accesses from inside the protected network
- Gather **information** to help prevention against future attacks
- Verify effectiveness of prevention mechanisms
- Document existing **threats**

IDSs can obtain information, not only through network monitoring and packet examination, but also looking at **sensible information** being **altered** (for example, multiple changes to a password database). Because of this, IDSs can help **detect**:

- Preliminary phases of attacks (probes, for example **port scans**)
- Attacks coming from **outside source** (for example, DDOS)
- Attacks coming from **internal source** (for example, virus in employee's computer connected to company LAN)

## Firewall vs IDS

We will now make a comparison between firewalls and IDSs:

**Firewall:**
- Acts through **packet-filtering** (looks at IP/TCP/UDP headers)
- Do not look **into** packets, nor create correlations between packets

**IDS:**
- **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):**
	- Can take a closer look at packet's content, and compare it to database of known attacks
- Can make **correlations between packets** (detect incoming DDOS attacks, port scanning, etc.)

## Attack Detection

Like we saw, IDSs detect attacks through packet inspection, correlation and comparison with known patterns. Once an attack is detected, an **alarm** is generated. The amount of alarms generated will depend on the IDS configuration: a stricter policy will generate more **false positives**, while a looser one will generate more **false negatives**.

:::info[Definition]
**False Positive:** The system reported an attack, but in reality it didn't exist
:::

:::info[Definition]
**False Negative:** The system didn't detect an attack, but in reality there was one
:::

## Honeypots

An IDS can also leverage the use of a **honeypot**. Honeypots are systems designed to be **vulnerable**, and to deceive the attacker into thinking that he can obtain something of value from them, when in fact it's sole purpose is to **attract attackers**. The objectives of honeypots are:

- Deceive an attacker from the true system
- Gather information about potential attacks
- Gather forensic information

It has a possible downside: honeypots can also be used by attackers as **attack origins**.

## IDS Classification

In this chapter we will look into possible different categories of how an IDS can function differently.
