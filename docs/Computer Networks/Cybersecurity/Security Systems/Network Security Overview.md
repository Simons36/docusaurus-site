# Network Security Overview

---
In this guide, we present a list of the possible **attack types** that can occur in communication between two parties, as well as the two possible **network security models**.

# Types of Attacks

- We can divide possible attacks into two types:

### Passive Attacks

- **Listen attack** (information disclosure):

- **Listen attack** (traffic analysis):

### Active attacks

- **Tampering attack:**

- **Replay attacks:**

- **DDOS** (denial of service attacks):

# Network Security Models

- There are **two** network security models:

### 1. Gateway

- **E.g.:** Firewall

### 2. Secure Channel

 - **E.g.:** TLS/SSL
