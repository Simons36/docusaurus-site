# Overview

In this section, you will find various notes covering multiple topics in **Computer Networks**.

This section is divided into two main areas:

**[Cybersecurity](./Cybersecurity/Basic%20Concepts%20in%20Software%20Security.md)**  
Focuses on protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It introduces core concepts and techniques to secure software and infrastructure from malicious actors. Divided into two subsections:  
  - **[Vulnerabilities](./Cybersecurity/Vulnerabilities/01-Web%20Vulnerabilities.md)** – Common types of software and web vulnerabilities, the mechanisms behind attacks, and how attackers exploit weak points.  
  - **[Security Systems](./Cybersecurity/Security%20Systems/01-Introduction%20to%20Cybersecurity%20in%20Networks%20and%20Systems.md)** – Tools, frameworks, and strategies to protect systems, including firewalls, intrusion detection, and authentication protocols.

**[Distributed Systems](./Distributed%20Systems/)**  
How systems are designed to run across multiple machines while maintaining consistency, availability, and fault tolerance. This section includes:  
  - **[Large Scale Systems Engineering](./Distributed%20Systems/Large%20Scale%20Systems%20Engineering/0.overview.md)** – Design principles, techniques, and challenges for building scalable systems, including capacity planning and self-adapting architectures.  
  - **[Distributed Registers](./Distributed%20Systems/Distributed%20Registers.md)** – Key abstractions for consistency and coordination across distributed nodes, including register types and behaviors in concurrent environments.
