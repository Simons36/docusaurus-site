# Overview

In this section, you will find various notes covering multiple topics in **Information Systems**.

This section focuses primarily on **Database Systems**, which are essential components of modern information systems. It covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementation strategies.

**[Database Systems](./Database%20Systems/File%20Organization.md)**  
Examines the internal structure and behavior of database systems, including how data is stored, indexed, queried, and optimized. Topics include:  
  - **[File Organization](./Database%20Systems/File%20Organization.md)** – Different methods of organizing data on disk, including heap files, sorted files, and hashed storage.  
  - **[Indexing](./Database%20Systems/Indexing.md)** – Techniques to improve query performance using indexes like B+ trees and hash-based indexes.  
  - **[Query Processing](./Database%20Systems/Query%20Processing.md)** – How queries are parsed, optimized, and executed internally by the database engine.  
  - **[Schema Tuning](./Database%20Systems/Schema%20Tuning.md)** – Strategies for designing and adjusting schema structures to improve performance and maintainability.  
  - **[Transaction and Concurrency](./Database%20Systems/Transaction%20and%20Concurrency.md)** – Ensuring consistency and isolation in multi-user environments through transaction management and concurrency control.
